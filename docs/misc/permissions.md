# Permissions

## Required Permissions

Friend Time requires the following permissions:

1. **Read Messages**
2. **Send Messages**
3. **Embed Links**
4. **Read Message History**
5. **Add Reactions**

When you invite Friend Time to your server, by default all of these permissions should be given to Friend Time. If you'd like to disable Friend Time for certain channels, feel free to remove these permissions in the channels you'd like to disable.

## Troubleshooting Issues

If you are experiencing issues with Friend Time not responding as expected, try giving Friend Time the **Administrator** permission temporarily. This can help determine if the issue if permission related or not.
